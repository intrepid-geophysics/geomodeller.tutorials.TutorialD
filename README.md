# GeoModeller Tutorial D (Geothermal and Microseismic)
## GeoModeller v4.0
Each of the Tutorials in the Intrepid-Geophysics workspace is intended for use with GeoModeller v4.0. If you do not own GeoModeller v4.0 and would like to know more, please do not hesitate to [Contact Us](http://www.intrepid-geophysics.com/ig/index.php?page=contact-us) 
## Introduction
This tutorial is included as part of the GeoModeller v4.0 package, and is intended to be the fourth tutorial users should explore. This tutorial comes in nine parts, corresponding to D1-D9. In some sections, users are provided with either a **beginning** version or a **completed** version of the project. The tutorial will inform you which project to load to start a section.
### Tutorial D1
In this tutorial you will open an existing project in preparation for section D2.

You will learn:
*  How to load a project
* Terminology of the GeoModeller workspace
### Tutorial D2
In this tutorial you will go through the various views and visualisers available to you and how to best use them to examine your model. 

You will learn how to:
* Navigate through and using various display windows

### Tutorial D3
In this tutorial you will use an existing a geology map and geo-register it on to a project's TopoMap Section.

You will learn how to:
* Edit and Align images

### Tutorial D4
In this tutorial you will create a formation and update its Stratigraphy.

You will learn how to:
* Create a new geology object
* Update the Stratigraphic pile

### Tutorial D5
In this tutorial you will take the new geology object from D4, then digitise and recompute the model.

You will learn how to:
* Digitise a created geological body
* Compute and Visualise in 2D and 3D

### Tutorial D6
In this tutorial you will import drillhole data from file and use that data to make changes to your model that you will once again recompute.

You will learn how to:
* Import data from Drillholes and project it onto vertical cross-sections
* Respond to discrepancies between the new data and the existing model
* Create a new fault

### Tutorial D7
In this tutorial you will enter Thermal properties for geological objects.

You will learn how to:
* Edit thermal properties of several geological bodies

### Tutorial D8
In this tutorial you will use the Thermal data set in D7 to generate a foward model and visualise these results.

You will learn how to:
* Calculate a Thermal forward Model
* Visualise the resulting MeshGrid Field

### Tutorial D9
In this tutorial you will import MicroSeismic Data in a CSV format, and then visualise and interperate the resultant seismic cloud.

You will learn to:
* Import MicroSeismic data into GeoModeller
* Visualise seismic clouds and analyse the results
